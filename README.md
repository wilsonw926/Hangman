# UC Berkeley iOS Decal - Project 1: Hangman (Final Screenshots Below)#

## Description ##
In this project, you will be making an iOS application for the Hangman game. Users should be able to start a game, make guesses for a phrase (list of phrases provided), see their progresses toward the phrase, see a list of previously guessed, incorrect letters, see how many guesses they have left (indicated by a hangman image - basic images provided), be alerted of a win or loss, and start a new game.
